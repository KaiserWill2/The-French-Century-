ENG_comrades_desc:0 "Mosley narrowly lost the Election of 1930 to incumbent Lord Protector Arthur Wellesley. But with Mosley's party being the most popular party in the nation, Wellesley appointed Mosley as Prime Minister. Wellesley died in 1934 with Mosley becoming Lord Protector but remained Prime Minister. Although unconstitutional, Mosley merged both posts into the Grand Protector and took complete control of the nation. To reassure his fellow Britons of the future, he has prepared to give a speech."
