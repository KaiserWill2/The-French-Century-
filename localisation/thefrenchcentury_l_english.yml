Browder was interrupted on his walk by multiple men in dark suits and soon an argument between Browder and these men broke out. Several shots were fired and Browder was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead at the scene."

thefrenchcentury.2.title:0 "Fire at the CPA HQ"
thefrenchcentury.2.desc:0 "Soon after Browder was killed, a large fire mysteriously started at the CPA HQ that resulted in the entire building being burned to the ground. At least 12 people were trapped inside the building during this fire but no one has survived to give an explanation on to how or why this happened. Many are beginning to believe that this and the death of Browder were ordered by William Dudley Pelley but the ANP has dismissed these accusations."
thefrenchcentury.2.a:0 "I wonder who did that?"
thefrenchcentury.3.title:0 "The Assassination of President Garner"
thefrenchcentury.3.desc:0 "With tension at an all time high and Garner becoming the most unpopular president in American history due to his poor handling of the economy, poverty, and the following Great Depression, it seems President Garner's luck has finally ran out. The President was touring the country giving speeches to try and sway the public to re-elect him. He was giving a speech in New York when suddenly three loud shots went off and the head of the President exploded. Guards rushed to try and protect the president but it was too late. Garner's head was now a pile of red mist and splattered brains. Vice President MacArthur is expected to be officially sworn in as the 33rd President of these United States. People have begun to theorize who was truly behind the death of Garner with the possible culprits ranging from Freemasons, Communists, Pelley, Huey Long, and even other worldly beings!"
thefrenchcentury.3.a:0 "On to the ingratiation!"
thefrenchcentury.4.title:0 "The Inauguration of Douglas MacArthur"
thefrenchcentury.4.desc:0 "MacArthur stood straight up, facing the Chief Justice, and repeating what he had been told to say. "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." MacArthur said. "So help me God," the Chief Justice said and MacArthur repeated. It was all coming together for MacArthur, his political enemies would likely be dead in a ditch soon and he was now in the most powerful office in the United States. He walked up to a nearby podium and began to deliver a speech. "My fellow Americans, we live in such a terrifying time with our lives being threatened at nearly every turn. I plan to make America safe again and finally end this Great Depression. Thank you!" MacArthur proclaimed. He had to attend to other duties such as running the country, continuing Garner's election campaign, and making this country "safe"."
